1. Google_image_3 is the 3rd version, it basically can google scrape with or without browser from popping out and
it adapted some of the codes from bing.py and https://pycheat.com/download_img.php

2. So just input your SEARCH_TERM into the google_scrape.xlsx in SEARCH_TERM column 
3. Pls mount your chrome Selenium driver path in line 27 and mount your google_scrape.xlsx path in line 26
4. if you don't want browser pop out/headless mode, please uncomment out options.add_argument("--headless") in line 19.
(however, the image amount in headless mode is not optimal)
